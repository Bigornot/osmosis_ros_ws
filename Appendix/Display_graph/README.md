The display_graph folder is made to modify an image in order to let the graph appear.

1. First, use the executable "exec_graph_to_array" (which is the executable from the file graph_to_array.cpp) that will convert the "test.graph" file into a more readable "file.txt".

2. Then, execute array_to_image.py that will copy the image "blagnac.jpg", modify it and save it under the name of "blagnac_graph.jpg". You will still need to copy this new image into the right folder that is used by gazebo to create the world.
