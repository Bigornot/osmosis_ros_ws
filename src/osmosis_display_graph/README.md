The osmosis_display_graph folder is made to modify an image in order to draw the corresponding graph on it.

The original image is named "blagnac.jpg" and is located in the ressources folder, next to the "blagnac.graph" file.
The altered image with the graph drawn on it is saved under the name "blagnac.jpg" in "osmosis_simulation >> models", thus it can be used as the map of the simulation.

If you want to use the "graph_to_image.py" with another image, you will probably need to find another formula to convert from coordinate to pixels.
